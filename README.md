# TLDR

```
make run
```


# vue-template

I am a noob to frontend. But I would like to get access to an environment which is easier for me to get started to only focus on minor changes that I need to.

This is one template to provide myself an ILLUSION that I can launch an enviornment with one click.



## Where does the template come from

You don't have to do the following but the document here is for curious folk:

Follow https://cli.vuejs.org/#getting-started:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create template
```

## I have no idea of front-end but just wanna run it with one click

```
make run
```

Then you shall see the terminal says:

```
